# Country-GDP-analysis
### Project Title: Country GDP Analysis Using Pandas DataFrame
### Project Overview: This project involves a thorough analysis of global GDP data using Pythonâ€™s Pandas library. The goal is to examine and visualize GDP trends across different countries and regions, identify patterns, and gain insights into economic performance on a global scale. By leveraging Pandas, the project aims to perform data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization to better understand economic disparities and growth trends.

#### Objectives:

Data Import and Cleaning: Load and preprocess the GDP dataset to ensure it is accurate and ready for analysis. Handle any missing values, inconsistencies, or outliers.
Descriptive Statistics: Use Pandas to compute key statistics and metrics related to GDP, such as mean, median, and growth rates.
Data Visualization: Create visual representations of GDP data to illustrate trends, comparisons, and distributions.
